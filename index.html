								<h2>Laid Off Calgary has evolved!</h2>

								<p>We now offer both in-person meetups (in small, facilitated peer support groups) and a confidential, closed online group on Facebook, for job seekers and people struggling with the downturn. 
								

								If you are a job seeker or have been laid off from your job in Calgary, we offer support and help for the following:
								<b><ul>
								<li> Managing the stress and fear of your laid off experience</li>
								<li> Understanding the psychological aspects of job loss and what you can do about it</li>
								<li> Combatting the isolation and loss of self that can accompany unemployment</li>
								<li> Strategies for job search and how to effectively manage your time during transition, and so much more...</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p>Both the in-person and online Laid Off Calgary groups provide additional knowledge sharing, peer support and resources.<p>  

								<ul>
								<li>Many participants of Laid Off Calgary have since found work. Attending a group meeting doesn't guarantee a job but you will gain something different every time that can help you during your transition, cope better, pick up specific tips and resources, form new connections with other people and not feel so alone!</li>
								<p></p>

								<li>The group meetings are facilitated by trained volunteers. We employ different facilitation styles and coaching techniques to help you access your own inner wisdom and also provide a forum for listening to each other. Many members have new friends from the group and some have been able to help find others work.</li>
								<p></p>

								<li>We typically have a maximum of 12 attendees for each in person meeting, and there is always a mix of familiar faces and new. The smaller group format makes for more comfortable conversations. Our 90 minute meetings go very fast! Our meetings are very interactive and powerful learning opportunities. We also need to know the number of registrants so we we don't go over the room capacity so we do ask that people register their interest to attend following the links in eventbrite.com. [To find our meetings search eventbrite.com for "Laid Off Calgary"].</li></b>

								<li class="icon fa-users">
									<h3>Peter</h3>
									<p>“As a job seeker I look for peer support and the opportunity to discuss / network / jobs and careers. The support received in the meetings has helped me through the low periods and have been morale boosting. It has also made me aware that I am not alone and that there is a whole community of talented, intelligent and caring laid off people in Calgary.<br />
									<br />
									The group has connected me with 3rd party agency support (Career Connection for example) and as a result gained confidence with my resume, LinkedIn profile and networking opportunities. There has also been connection with recruitment agencies and Motivational speakers."</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-handshake-o">
									<h3>L.S</h3>
									<p>“Laid Off Calgary really offers an easy, comfortable, frontline option for those of us needing some support through a life changing experience, but who do not require or are not ready to access more formal community support agencies. It is unique because it is a casual atmosphere and offers a great sense of camaraderie and connectedness with people of all age groups, cultural backgrounds, work experience and duration of layoff"</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-comments">
									<h3>Warren</h3>
									<p>"I appreciate the support and being able to support others in the same situation. It is super important to have community and talk with others in the same boat."</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-fire">
									<h3>Steve</h3>
									<p>"I have never attended a support group before but this proved to be valuable for me."</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-briefcase">
									<h3>Lisa</h3>
									<p>"Peer support, encouragement/inspiration, tangible takewaway suggestions for job hunting"</p>
